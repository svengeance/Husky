# Husky - The Most Loyal and Reliable Installer, Powered by .NET Core

Husky aims to be an installer that lowers the barrier to entry through a revolutionary zero-code, configuration-based approach.
By offering a simple preconfigured approach to the most common tasks for any installer, Husky can pull you in the right direction quickly.
Should you need a more bespoke approach, there is no end to which Husky is configurable. Each step in the configuration file is comprised of .NET source code,
which the user has access to and can modify. This ultimate flexibility means that Husky should be able to support any bespoke need.
